What is SLI, SLO, SLA?

Imagine this story.

There is an online food delivery app called FastBite.
Lakhs of users use it every day to order food.

One day, the business owner asks the tech team one question:

“How reliable is our app for users?”

Now the team explains using SLI, SLO, and SLA.

First comes SLI.

SLI means Service Level Indicator.
This is what we actually measure.

In FastBite app, the DevOps team checks: How many requests are successful
How fast the app responds
How many times the app goes down

For example: Out of 1 lakh requests, 99,900 requests worked fine.

That measurement is SLI.
SLI is just data. It tells what is really happening.

Next comes SLO.

SLO means Service Level Objective.
This is the internal target set by the team.

The DevOps team says: Our goal is that 99.9 percent of requests should be successful every month.

This goal is not for customers. This is for engineers, monitoring, alerts, and improvements.

If the SLI goes below this target, the team knows something is wrong. They fix issues before customers complain.

That target is SLO.

Now comes SLA.

SLA means Service Level Agreement.
This is a promise made to customers.

FastBite tells restaurants and partners: We guarantee 99.5 percent uptime every month. If we fail, we will give compensation.

This is written in a legal agreement. Business teams, not engineers, usually define SLA.

So in simple words:

SLI answers: What is actually happening in production?

SLO answers: What level of reliability do we want to maintain?

SLA answers: What have we officially promised to customers?

One important thing.

SLO is always stricter than SLA. Why?

Because if engineers only aim for SLA, any small issue will break the promise.

So DevOps teams aim higher internally, so customers stay happy externally.

Final takeaway for students:

SLI is measurement
SLO is internal goal
SLA is external promise

If you understand this, you understand how real production systems are managed.
